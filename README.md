## Overview

Web developers generally upload the content of their websites to a central server. The central server serves the requests of all the clients. This approach may raise performance, security, and robustness issues. As well as, the website becomes unavailable during maintenance and heavy workload time. Therefore, in this project, we decided to split website content into granules and distribute it all over the internet and then link them together using a blockchain registry.
